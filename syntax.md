# **My Project Plan (Level 1 Heading)**
***Note:*** This document is written merely as an illustrative example, and does not provide any working guide to an actual project. 

### Proposal (Level 3 Heading)
--- 
I am planning to make a computer vision software that detect object in images.
In order to build it, I will use opencv, deep learning libraries, such as [TensorFlow]() or [Pytorch](), and other open source softwares.

For example, the objects in the following images were detected using [mmdetection]():

### Deppendecies (Level 3 Heading)
- python
- opencv-python
- tensorflow
- openmmlab
- package manager

### Installation
In a bash terminal, run the following commands (*Do NOT actually run these commands in your computer*):
```sh
$ sudo apt update
$ conda crate -n cv_detection
$ conda activate cv_detection
$ python --version
$ python example.py
```
